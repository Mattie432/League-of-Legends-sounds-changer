# League of Legends sound changer
This was a short project I was working on just to learn the basics of c++ and to change the league sounds to Korean. Code was in a working state however riot have changed the way that locals are stored in league so the method to download the sounds via the client no longer works. If it is found how that works then this program can be modified to work again.
